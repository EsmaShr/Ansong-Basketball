      <p>This was a great learning experience for him dealing with all age groups and being able to commence small group clinics for player development was a plus, especially for players preparing themselves for the upcoming season. The highest level of coaching for him is on the Amateur athletic union level. He worked with his local gym as a private skills trainer for basketball and trained anyone that was a member/nonmember. Heâ€™s fortunate to work players of all ages, levels, and abilities to help motivate and guide them along their journey.</p>

        <p>Michael has a professional skill level to demonstrate for his players but also the knowledge needed to improve every aspect of their game.</p>
